    <p>
        The Summer 2024 section of ECE374 will be taught by Abhishek Umrawal and Nickvash Kani. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Professor Umrawal will teach and manage the first four weeks of the semester. These weeks are devoted to Computational Complexity Theory and Automata Theory.   
    </p>
    <p>    
        Prof. Kani will teach the second four weeks of the course devoted to basic algorithms and algorithmic complexity theory. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While we will try to maintain a common infrastructure, each professor has a slgihtly different teaching style and as such, there will be differences between the two halves of the course. Each professor will communicate the expectations and schedule for theri section of the course before the start of their section. Each professor will give you a raw grade for their section of the course. The two raw grades will then be averaged together and the final grade will be determined by this average curved according to the class distribution.
