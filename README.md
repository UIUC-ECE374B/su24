This is the official website of ECE374-B at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for the Summer 2024 semester. This site is built on the archive site that I (Nickvash Kani) maintain. This site will be deleted once the semester is over. 

This website is a culmination of a lot of different code/design snippets from a lot of different authors. These include: 

- Website skeleton from [Sampa research group website](https://github.com/uwsampa/research-group-web)
- Exam/homework tables from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp)
- Office hours schedule from [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-conference-schedule-with-css-grid/)
- Data styling in lecture/lab page from [Line25](https://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-cool-blog-post-date-icon-with-css/)
- Button styling from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp)
- Date formatting from [Alan Smith](https://www.alanwsmith.com/posts/jekyll-and-github-pages-liquid-date-formatting-examples--20emx2csq8do)


And above all, most of the materials are adapted from prior works from all the prior 374 instructors:
