As a general rule I am willing to share most of my work and content but I 
hesitate slightly because I don't want dozens of this sites out in the aether
confusing individuals about what/where the original site is. For this reason, 
please just comment on this project or dm me and we can work out a license 
agreement. As long as your new site is different enough from the ecealgo site 
where it won't cause confusion, I don't mind sharing (or even assisting) with
the code.
