Hello everyone and welcome to the ECE374B-SU24-PartB where we will discuss algorithmic concepts. I am so excited to begin and hope you guys are ready to learn: recursion, dynamic programming, graphing algorithms, reductions and so much more!

This course is intense. In a typical semester, not only does it have lectures, but it has discussion sections as well. Unfortunately, the summer scheduling only gave us one class session a day. 

So I'm thinking we can do a flipped classroom method. Before every class, you will asynchronously watch a lecture recording and gain an understanding of the core concepts. From that you will come to class and we will do a discussion section which is basically solving some practical problems together. Finally, after you have mastered the concepts, in the evening you can/should complete the relevant HW problem to what we discussed that day. 

I know it's an intense schedule, but I promise as long as we remain diligent, the weeks will fly by and you will gain a mastery of the most essential algorithmic concepts. These simple algorithms will come up in interviews so work hard and I promise you will be rewarded! 

See you guys Monday! -Nickvash Kani
